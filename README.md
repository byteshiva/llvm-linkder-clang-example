# LLVM Linker Example with Clang and Nix Flakes

This repository contains an example project demonstrating the usage of the LLVM linker with Clang in the context of Nix Flakes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Nix installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://nixos.org/guides/install-nix.html).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/byteshiva/llvm-linker-clang-example.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd llvm-linker-clang-example
    ```

3. Enter the Nix development environment:

    ```bash
    nix develop
    ```

4. Build and run the program:

    ```bash
    ./my_program
    ```

This will compile the source files, create a library, and link them using Clang and LLVM.

Feel free to explore the project and modify it according to your needs!
